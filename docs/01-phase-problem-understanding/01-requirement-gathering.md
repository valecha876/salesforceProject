# Phase 1: Requirement Gathering

## 1.1 Problem Statement

Organizations face mounting pressure from regulators, investors, and customers to accurately measure, report, and reduce their greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. The current process is characterized by manual data collection from disparate sources (utility bills, travel logs, supply chain spreadsheets), leading to time-consuming calculations, high error rates, and a lack of auditability. This inefficiency creates significant operational risk, hinders sustainability initiatives, and prevents companies from leveraging their environmental data within their core commercial strategy.

## 1.2 Project Vision

To develop a native Salesforce application that automates the carbon accounting process, transforming disconnected operational data into auditable, actionable, and insightful emissions data directly within the CRM. This will empower organizations to meet compliance demands, make strategic reduction decisions, and enhance customer relationships with validated sustainability metrics.

## 1.3 High-Level Requirements

### Functional Requirements
1.  **Data Management:**
    *   The system shall allow for manual entry of activity data (e.g., kWh, liters, km) via a user-friendly interface.
    *   The system shall support bulk data import from CSV files.
    *   The system shall provide a framework for connecting to external data sources via API (future state).

2.  **Emissions Calculation:**
    *   The system shall store a library of emission factors (e.g., from GHG Protocol, DEFRA) as configurable records.
    *   The system shall automatically calculate CO2 equivalent (CO2e) emissions upon data entry or import by multiplying activity data by the appropriate emission factor.
    *   Calculations must be categorized by emission Scope (1, 2, and 3).

3.  **Salesforce Integration:**
    *   All data (activity data, emission factors, results) shall be stored in custom objects within Salesforce.
    *   Emissions records shall be relationally linked to standard Salesforce objects (e.g., Account, Contact, Opportunity).

4.  **Reporting & Visualization:**
    *   The system shall provide pre-built Salesforce reports and dashboards to visualize emissions over time, by scope, and by business unit.
    *   Users must be able to export report data for external disclosure.

### Non-Functional Requirements
1.  **Security:** The application must comply with Salesforce's security model and pass the Security Review for AppExchange listing.
2.  **Performance:** Data calculation and dashboard loading must be efficient, even with large datasets.
3.  **Usability:** The interface must be intuitive for non-technical users, such as Sustainability Managers.
4.  **Auditability:** All data and calculations must be traceable to provide a clear audit trail for compliance reporting.
